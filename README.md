I made this repo only because they taught us programming in Bayes using the OpenBUGs windows software in the Bayesian Statistics [course](https://omscs.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/course_page_docs/syllabi/2019-3_isye_6420_syllabus_and_schedule.pdf) at school and didn't really provide a lot of education on the pythonic way of doing it, so much of the learning was on my own, and in the Jupyter notebook under `project` . 

So saving this for future reference

## Summary
Studies have shown that poor web page performance causes consumers to lose interest and bounce (abandon their session). In this project, I analyzed data from a public website for the month of October 2021 to accomplish the following goals using Bayesian Statistical Methods
- To identify, out of all page latency variables available, which single predictor explains the page abandonment the most
- To assess the Bayesian model's prediction accuracy the level of page abandonment using the single predictor.
