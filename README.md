Bayesian Statistics - Fall 2021 ISYE6420

I made this repo only because they taught us programming in Bayes using the OpenBUGs windows software in the Bayesian Statistics (course)[https://omscs.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/course_page_docs/syllabi/2019-3_isye_6420_syllabus_and_schedule.pdf] at school and didn't really provide a lot of education on the pythonic way of doing it, so much of the learning was on my own, and in the Jupypter notebook under `project` . 

So saving this for future reference
